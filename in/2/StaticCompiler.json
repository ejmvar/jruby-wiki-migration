This document discusses possible ways this compiler will function.\n\nGiven the following simple method:\n\n class MyClass\n   def foo(a, b); end\n end\n\nWe would expect the compiler to produce the following code:\n\n public class MyClass < IRubyObject {\n   public Object foo(Object a, Object b) {\n     Object result = callMethod(\"foo\", JavaUtil.convertJavaToRuby(a), JavaUtil.convertJavaToRuby(b));\n     return JavaUtil.convertRubyToJava(result);\n   }\n }\n\nThis is a simple place to start.\n\n'''Questions, concerns:'''\n\n* Should underscore_case methods be compiled as camelCase? configurable?\n* We need to clearly specify what <tt>JavaUtil</tt> will do for all sorts of types.\n\n'''Primary requirements:'''\n\n* No modification of Ruby's grammar should be necessary; the code should be runnable in interpreted mode.\n* To the greatest extent possible, support all of Ruby's grammar being compiled into a static set of classes and methods.\n* Whether it must be a complete no-op or whether a small library of no-op functions would be needed in interpreted mode is up for debate.\n\n===Specifying types===\n\nA few possible syntaxes:\n\n {[:String, :Integer] => :int}\n def foo(a, b) ...\n\n [:String, :Integer] << :int\n def foo(a, b) ...\n\n java_method {\n   params String, int\n   return int\n }\n def foo(a, b) ...\n\n def foo(a, b) ...\n ...\n java_method :foo, [:String, :Integer] => :int\n\nThose with a method call would require some noop library to run correctly in interpreted mode.\n\n===Annotations===\n\nA few possible syntaxes\n\n @MyAnno = {:baz => \"blah\"}\n def foo() ...\n\n annotate { MyAnno(baz = \"blah\") }\n def foo() ...\n\n def foo() ...\n ...\n annotate :foo { MyAnno(bar = \"blah\") }\n\n===Attributes===\n\nIt's mostly a no-brainer that attributes should get compiled into Java get/set methods.\n\nThe following class\n class Blah\n   attr_accessor :foo\n end\n\nshould produce the following in the resulting Java class:\n public Object getFoo();\n public void setFoo(Object foo);\n","created_at":"2009-07-31T23:59:59Z","content_type":"application/vnd.com.kenai.page.revision+json"}
