In this example I'll use the jdbcmysql adapter and my application name will be radiantblog.\n\n  jruby -S radiant --database=mysql radiantblog\n\nTo set up the database connections edit radiantblog/config/database.yml and create the database as well.\n\n  production:\n    adapter: jdbcmysql\n    database: radiantblog_production\n    username: usr\n    password: passwd\n    host: localhost\n\nYou can omit to set up other database configurations for now and correct it later.\n\n  jruby -S rake production db:bootstrap\n\nThe bootstrap task will populate your database and set up a basic administration and page system based on your answers to the setup questions in the terminal. To start your application issue the familiar Rails command.\n\n  jruby script/server -e production\n\nFire up your browser and play around a little with your new CMS - [http://localhost:3000]\n\n==Deployment==\n\nMy first deployment was under a Tomcat 6 with the [[Warbler]] gem.\n\n  jruby -S warble config\n\nMy minimal config file is as follows.\n\n  Warbler::Config.new do |config|\n    config.dirs = %w(cache config db log vendor tmp)\n    config.gems += [\"activerecord-jdbcmysql-adapter\", \"radiant\"]\n    config.gem_dependencies = true\n    config.war_name = \"ROOT\"\n  end\n\nI set the war name to ROOT to avoid the problems with the default Radiant routing and assets including.\n\n  jruby -S warble:war\n\nDeploy your generated war file under Tomcat's webapps folder, start the server and check http://localhost:8080 for your CMS.\n","created_at":"2009-04-29T08:29:54Z","content_type":"application/vnd.com.kenai.page.revision+json"}
