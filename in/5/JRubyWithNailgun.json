Nailgun allows you to start up a single JVM as a background server process and toss it commands from a fast native client almost eliminating JRuby's annoyingly slow start up time. To use Nailgun with JRuby:\n\n# Download JRuby.\n# Expand the JRuby archive (source or binary) and change to the distribution directory.\n# If you are running on UNIX-like OS, build the nailgun server with either:\n## <code>ant build-ng</code> (JRuby 1.4.0 and later)\n## <code>cd tool/nailgun; configure; make</code>\n# Start the JRuby nailgun server in the background: <code>jruby --ng-server &</code>\n# You can now run JRuby commands through that server using the <code>jruby --ng</code> command instead of <code>jruby</code>\n\nFor more information, read [http://blog.headius.com/2009/05/jruby-nailgun-support-in-130.html]\n\n==Note on development with Nailgun==\nIf you rebuild JRuby, be sure to restart the nailgun server; or else the client will get incorrect results.","created_at":"2009-11-13T05:33:31Z","content_type":"application/vnd.com.kenai.page.revision+json"}
