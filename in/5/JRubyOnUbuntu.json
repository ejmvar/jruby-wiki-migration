When running <tt>jruby -v</tt>,  you might get exceptions from Java. The reason for these errors might be that, even though you have an up-to-date JDK installed, Ubuntu is not using it by default. You need to update your configuration to use the proper JDK.  See [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java] for more information on this issue.\n\nOn Ubuntu 7.10, I ran\n java -version\nwhich said that I was running  Java version 1.5.0 when I knew I had Java version 1.6 installed. I then ran:\n sudo update-alternatives --config java\nI picked the option <tt>/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/jre/bin/java</tt>.  Following that, running <tt>java -version</tt> \ngave me\n java version \"1.6.0_03\"\n Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_03-b05)\n Java HotSpot(TM) Server VM (build 1.6.0_03-b05, mixed mode)\n\nAnd JRuby then worked fine.\n","created_at":"2009-06-14T23:00:12Z","content_type":"application/vnd.com.kenai.page.revision+json"}
