It is Ruby for the JVM.\n\nJRuby provides a complete set of core \"builtin\" classes and syntax for the Ruby language, as well as most of the Ruby Standard Libraries. The standard libraries are mostly Ruby's own complement of <tt>.rb</tt> files, but a few that depend on C language-based extensions have been reimplemented. Some are still missing, but we hope to implement as many as is feasible.\n\nSee [[DifferencesBetweenMriAndJruby|Differences Between MRI And JRuby]] for more information on potential incompatibilities between JRuby and the C implementation of Ruby.\n\n==Development Team==\nJRuby's current core development team consists of six developers:\n\n*Charles Oliver Nutter (Sun Microsystems) aka headius\n*Thomas Enebo (Sun Microsystems) aka enebo\n*Nick Sieger (Sun Microsystems)\n*Ola Bini (Thoughtworks)\n*Marcin Mielzynski aka lopex\n*Bill Dortch\n*Wayne Meissner\n\n==Links==\n*[http://jruby.codehaus.org JRuby's project page at Codehaus]\n*[http://headius.blogspot.com Charles Oliver Nutter's blog]\n*[http://www.bloglines.com/blog/ThomasEEnebo/ Thomas Enebo's blog]\n*[http://olabini.com/blog Ola Bini's blog]\n*[http://blog.nicksieger.com/ Nick Sieger's blog]\n*[http://www.java201.com/resources/browse/jruby.html JRuby related articles]\n*[http://www.jrubyhub.com JRubyHub.com: The hub for all resources related to JRuby and JRuby on Rails resources]\n","created_at":"2009-06-14T23:14:24Z","content_type":"application/vnd.com.kenai.page.revision+json"}
