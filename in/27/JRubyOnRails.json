JRuby gives Rails the power and functionality of the Java Platform,  providing it with:\n* Excellent garbage collection for endless uptimes\n* Hotspot profiled dynamic optimizations for great performance\n* Access to the Java ecosphere for additional technology options\n* Deployment to Java application servers for ubiquity\n\n\n__TOC__\n===Getting Started===\nGet started with these tutorials:\n\n*[http://blog.emptyway.com/2008/04/08/120-seconds-guide-to-jruby-on-rails| 120-second guide to JRuby on Rails]\n*[http://thenice.tumblr.com/post/133345213/deploying-a-rails-application-in-tomcat-with-jruby-a| Deploying a Rails application in Tomcat with JRuby: A concise tutorial]\n\n=== Deployment ===\n\n==== War File Deployment ====\nIf you don't use a traditional Ruby application server like [http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/ Mongrel], you can use a Java application server.  To deploy to a Java app server, you can use the tool [[Warbler]]  to bundle your Rails application in a Java Web Application Archive (<tt>.war</tt> file). (Warbler is a minimal, flexible, Ruby-like way to create a <tt>.war</tt> file). Once you have a <tt>.war</tt> file, you can deploy to any Java app server using their war deployment mechanism.  \n\n'''Some links to information on various Java App Servers:'''\n* [http://atalks.prokhorenko.us/2009/02/ruby-on-rails-application-migrating.html Tomcat]\n* [[JRuby on Rails on Jetty|Jetty]]\n* [[JRuby on Rails on WebSphere|WebSphere]]\n* [http://wiki.oracle.com/page/JRuby+on+Rails%3A+Deploying+to+Oracle+Containers+for+Java+EE+%28OC4J%29 Oracle OC4J]\n* [[JRuby on Rails on BEA Weblogic|Weblogic]]\n* [http://oddthesis.org/theses/jboss-rails JBoss]\n* [http://blogs.sun.com/sabada/entry/deploying_jruby_on_rails_war JWS 7]\n\n==== Glassfish v3 Deployment ====\nYou can use the glassfish gem by Vivek Pandey to deploy JRuby on Rails very easily and robustly. With the glassfish gem, you can deploy your application to the Glassfish v3 modularized Java Application Server. The glassfish gem wraps the essential technologies in 3 mbs and enables you to run your application just like you would with a traditional approach with Mongrel, Rack, and so on. A brief tutorial can be found here: [[JRuby on Rails with Glassfish gem]].\n\nSee also:\n* [[JRuby on Rails in GlassFish|Glassfish]]\n\n\n==== Traditional Rails Deployment ====\n\n* [http://glassfishgem.rubyforge.org/ Glassfish Gem on Rubyforge]\n* [http://weblogs.java.net/blog/vivekp/archive/2009/03/new_features_in.html New features in GlassFish 0.9.3 gem]\n* [http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/ Mongrel web site]\n* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongrel_(web_server) Mongrel Web Server entry on Wikipedia]\n* [http://swiftiply.swiftcore.org/mongrel.html Swiftiply with Mongrel]\n* [http://www.webrick.org/ WEBrick website]\n* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WEBrick WEBrick entry on Wikipedia]\n* [http://microjet.ath.cx/WebWiki/WEBrick.html Gnome's Guide to WEBrick]\n* [http://modrails.com Passenger]\n\n=== Miscellaneous Rails Topics ===\n* '''[[Rails_2_3_2|Important note about Rails 2.3.2]]'''\n* [http://blarg.slackworks.com/posts/jndi-with-rails Blog entry on setting up JNDI]\n* [[RailsJSR286Portlets|Write Portlets using Rails]]\n* [http://blarg.slackworks.com/posts/jruby-service-in-rails JRuby Services in Rails]\n* [[Running Rails with Firebird]]\n* [[Rails AOT|Compiling Rails' controllers and models AOT]]\n* [[Rails Eclipse Jetty Maven|Rails on Eclipse + Run Jetty Run + Maven]]\n* [http://kofno.wordpress.com/2008/04/23/writing-an-activerecord-jdbc-adapter/ Writing an ActiveRecord-JDBC adapte","created_at":"2009-07-01T23:48:52Z","content_type":"application/vnd.com.kenai.page.revision+json"}
