However, in order to support Rails 2.0 out of the box, we implemented a limited subset of openssl that implements <tt>OpenSSL::HMAC</tt> and <tt>OpenSSL::Digest</tt>.\n\nHowever, this breaks programs that use <tt>require 'openssl'</tt> as a test for whether openssl is available or not. [http://dev.ctor.org/soap4r Soap4r] is one such program. In order to support this behavior, simply add\n\n    require 'jruby/openssl/gem_only'\n\nat the start of your program, and requiring openssl will revert to raising a load error.\n\nSee also [http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JRUBY-1808 JRUBY-1808] for a discussion on this feature. \n","created_at":"2009-03-24T22:44:14Z","content_type":"application/vnd.com.kenai.page.revision+json"}
