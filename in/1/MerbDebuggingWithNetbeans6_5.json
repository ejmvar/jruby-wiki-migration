There's info how to install this gem here: http://wiki.netbeans.org/RubyDebugging#section-RubyDebugging-JRuby\n\nAfter we have installed those gems, it's time for little hack in out Merb application:\nin Application ROOT do the following:\n\n <nowiki>mkdir script</nowiki>\n\n <nowiki>touch server</nowiki>\n\nand put there this content:\n\n\n <nowiki>\n #!/usr/bin/env ruby\n require 'rubygems'\n version = \">= 0\"\n if ARGV.first =~ /^_(.*)_$/ and Gem::Version.correct? $1 then\n version = $1\n ARGV.shift\n end\n gem 'merb-core', version\n load 'merb'\n </nowiki>\n\n\nNote: that it's working properly with Mongrel server only. It seems there's a bug in Glassfish delivered with Netbeans 6.5 and this application server wont work with debugger. (in my case)\n\nNote: It does not work with newer Merb version which is executed in different way than before. Workaround needed!\n","created_at":"2009-03-23T11:50:28Z","content_type":"application/vnd.com.kenai.page.revision+json"}
