The resulting files can be read by a continuous integration system that understands Ant's JUnit report XML format, thus allowing your CI system to track test/spec successes and failures.''\r\n\r\n* [http://blog.nicksieger.com/articles/2007/01/06/continuous-integration-goodness-tm-for-your-ruby-project Continuous Integration Goodness(TM) for Your Ruby Project] (Nick Sieger)\r\n** [http://svn.caldersphere.net/svn/main/ci_reporter/ ci-reporter] (Nick Sieger)\r\n*** [http://svn.caldersphere.net/svn/main/ci_reporter/README.txt ci_reporter doc]\r\n\r\n== CI Implementations  ==\r\n\r\n=== Bamboo ===\r\nhttp://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo/\r\nDeveloper Source (proprietary, but you get source code with purchase)\r\n\r\nConfirmed to work with JRuby\r\n\r\n==== Basic Configuration ====\r\n* Create a \"Builder: \r\n** Label: \"JRuby\"\r\n** Type: Custom Command  \t\r\n** Path: your $JRUBY_HOME\r\n* Builder Configuration\r\n** Argument: $JRUBY_HOME/bin/rake test\r\n\r\n==== Blog Posts ====\r\n* [http://furiouspurpose.blogspot.com/2007/07/ruby-on-rails-continuously-integrated.html Ruby on Rails continuously integrated with Bamboo] (Geoffrey Wiseman)\r\n* [http://furiouspurpose.blogspot.com/2007/07/bamboo-ruby-on-rails-test-reports-and.html Bamboo, Ruby on Rails, Test Reports and RCov] (Geoffrey Wiseman)\r\n\r\n=== Cruisecontrol ===\r\nhttp://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/\r\nFOSS\r\n\r\n=== Cruisecontrol.rb ===\r\nhttp://cruisecontrolrb.thoughtworks.com/\r\nFOSS\r\n\r\n=== Hudson ===\r\nhttps://hudson.dev.java.net/\r\nFOSS\r\n\r\nConfirmed to work with JRuby\r\n\r\nSee instructions in [http://blog.huikau.com/2008/01/09/jruby-ruby-continuous-integration-with-hudson/ JRuby / Ruby Continuous Integration with Hudson] to configure.\r\n\r\nIt also can execute Rake tasks as build steps.

Add ideas here.\r\n\r\n- I'd like Hudson to either support rake and ci:reporter out of the box, or for their to be a plugin to do this.
