(maybe sooner)\r\n* Big 0.9 release (0.9.8 or similar to convey importance)\r\n\r\n== March ==\r\n* Compiler earlies, potential JIT, likely faster than Ruby (the compiler is now consistently faster than Ruby 1.8, but is not yet enabled by default)\r\n* Rounding out features: native Unicode, Java integration (final syntax, \r\nperf improvements, thinning the proxy boundary) (Much of Java integration syntax is now final; however a large amount of backward-compatible redesign is planned for post 1.0)\r\n\r\n== April ==\r\n* Final release before 1.0 (0.9.9, likely)\r\n* Closing out 1.0 features, decide what makes it in\r\n* Major bug-hunting push, 1.0 release branch\r\n* Getting ducks in a row for JavaOne\r\n\r\n== May ==\r\n* Release 1.0 beta or RC, announce at JavaOne 2007 (beta or RC was chosen because JavaOne will drive a lot of bug-finders to JRuby; better to call it a beta or RC and release 1.0 final later than to immediately release 1.1 after JavaOne)\r\n* RailsConf 2007, continue the celebration\r\n* Cooling off: let 1.0 sink in, work on transparent improvements \r\n(compiler, backend; ease back features)\r\n\r\n== June, July ==\r\n* JRuby 1.0 final release, after a good several weeks of bake time\r\n* Move toward 1.1, improving Ruby/Java integration and Rubifying more libraries\r\n* Continuing work on the compiler, aiming for JIT enabled in 1.1\r\n","created_at":"2008-08-12T00:00:15Z","content_type":"application/vnd.com.kenai.page.revision+json"}
