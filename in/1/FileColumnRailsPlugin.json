This plugin inadvertently calls ARGV (due to \"require 'testcase'\"). RailsIntegration way of embedding JRuby doesn't init the constant ARGV. Just add ARGV = [] at the beginning of your environment.rb as a workaround.\r\n\r\n2. Process.pid method is called by this plugin which is not implemented in JRuby at this time. Search for this reference and remove it as it is pretty safe since in a WAR deployment there is generally likely to be only one instance.\r\n","created_at":"2008-08-12T21:10:10Z","content_type":"application/vnd.com.kenai.page.revision+json"}
