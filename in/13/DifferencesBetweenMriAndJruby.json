Some differences are due to bugs, and those are not reported here. This page is for differences that are not bugs.\n\n__TOC__\n\n== Native C Extensions==\nJRuby cannot run native C extensions.  Popular libraries have all generally been ported to Java Native Extensions.  Also, now that [http://kenai.com/projects/ruby-ffi/pages/Home FFI] has become a popular alternative to binding to C libraries, using it obviates the need to write a large chunk of native extensions.\n\n== Continuations ==\nJRuby does not support [http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/ref_c_continuation.html continuations] (<tt>[http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/ref_m_kernel.html#Kernel.callcc Kernel.callcc]</tt>).\n\n== Invoking external processes ==\nOn Microsoft Windows, JRuby is a little smarter when launching external processes. If the executable file is not a binary executable (<tt>.exe</tt>), MRI requires you give the file suffix as well, but JRuby manages without it.\n\nFor example, say you have file <tt>foo.bat</tt> on your PATH and want to run it. \n\n system( 'foo' ) # works on JRuby, fails on MRI\n system( 'foo.bat' ) # works both in JRuby and MRI\n\n== Fork is not implemented ==\nJRuby doesn't implement <tt>fork()</tt> on any platform, including those where <tt>fork()</tt> is available in MRI.\n\n== Native Endian is Big Endian ==\nSince the JVM presents a ''compatible'' CPU to JRuby, the ''native'' endianness of JRuby is Big Endian. This does matter for operations that depend on that behavior, like <tt>String#unpack</tt> and <tt>Array#pack</tt> for formats like <tt> I</tt>, <tt> i</tt>, <tt> S</tt>, and <tt> s</tt>.\n\n== Time precision ==\nSince it is not possible to obtain <tt>usec</tt> precision under a JVM, <tt>Time.now.usec</tt> cannot return values with microsecond precision.\n\n'''Example:'''\n\n > Time.now.usec\n => 582000\n\nKeep this in mind when counting on <tt>usec</tt> precision in your code.\n\n== Regular Expressions == \n\nJRuby only has one regular expression engine, which matches Onigurama's behavior. It is not changed in --1.8 mode, so code depending on regular expressions behaving precisely as on MRI 1.8.n may fail on JRuby in --1.8 mode. For instance:\n\n  ruby-1.8.7-p302 > \"a\".match(/^(.*)+$/)[1]\n  => \"a\"\n\n  jruby-head > \"a\".match(/^(.*)+$/)[1]\n  => \"\"","created_at":"2010-12-08T14:51:44Z","content_type":"application/vnd.com.kenai.page.revision+json"}
