To deploy to a Java app server, you can use the tool [[Warbler]], a minimal, flexible, Ruby-like way to create a <tt>.war</tt> file,  to bundle your Rails application in a Java Web Application Archive (<tt>.war</tt> file). Once you have a <tt>.war</tt> file, you can deploy to any Java app server using their war deployment mechanism.  \n\n'''Some links to information on various Java App Servers:'''\n* [http://atalks.prokhorenko.us/2009/02/ruby-on-rails-application-migrating.html Tomcat]\n* [[JRuby on Rails on Jetty|Jetty]]\n* [[JRuby on Rails in GlassFish|Glassfish]]\n* [[JRuby on Rails on WebSphere|Websphere]]\n* [http://wiki.oracle.com/page/JRuby+on+Rails%3A+Deploying+to+Oracle+Containers+for+Java+EE+%28OC4J%29 Oracle OC4J]\n* [[JRuby on Rails on BEA Weblogic|Weblogic]]\n* [http://oddthesis.org/theses/jboss-rails JBoss]\n* [http://blogs.sun.com/sabada/entry/deploying_jruby_on_rails_war JWS 7]\n\n==== Traditional Rails Deployment ====\n''Looking for content and links to pages on GFV3 gem, mongrel, webrick, etc...''\n\n=== Miscellaneous Rails Topics ===\n* '''[[Rails_2_3_2|Important note about Rails 2.3.2]]'''\n* [http://blarg.slackworks.com/posts/jndi-with-rails Blog entry on setting up JNDI]\n* [[RailsJSR286Portlets|Write Portlets using Rails]]\n* [http://blarg.slackworks.com/posts/jruby-service-in-rails JRuby Services in Rails]\n* [[Running Rails with Firebird]]\n* [[Rails AOT|Compiling Rails' controllers and models AOT]]\n* [[Rails Eclipse Jetty Maven|Rails on Eclipse + Run Jetty Run + Maven]]\n* [http://kofno.wordpress.com/2008/04/23/writing-an-activerecord-jdbc-adapter/ Writing an ActiveRecord-JDBC adapter]\n* [[Rails Multi-Threading Best Practices]]\n\n=== Old Topics ===\n* [[Goldspike|Goldpsike Servlet to Rails bridge]] - Deprecated, see [[Warbler]]\n* [[RailsWithH2InJNDIOnJetty]] - This page is out of date\n\n===See Also===\n'''JRuby Wiki pages'''\n* [[Warbler | Warbler (minimal, flexible, ruby-like way to create .war file)]] \n* [[Goldspike | Goldspike (Servlet to Rails bridge)]] \n* [[Jruby on Rails on Tomcat]] - Rails 1.1 & 2.0\n* [[JRuby on Rails in GlassFish | GlassFish (Open Source Application Server for Java EE 5)]]\n'''External links'''\n* [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/techjournal/0801_shillington/0801_shillington.html JRuby on Rails on WebSphere]\n* [http://headius.blogspot.com/2006/11/advanced-rails-deployment-with-jruby.html Advanced Rails Deployment with JRuby]\n* [http://blogs.sun.com/whacko/entry/deploying_a_ruby_on_rails Deploying JRuby on Rails as a WAR]\n* [http://wiki.sprocket.slackworks.com/instiki/published/Slackocity A Rails plugin that uses Velocity as the templating engine for ActionView]\n* [http://smartic.us/2007/8/11/smarticast-3-jruby-on-rails-on-jboss Screencast that demos deploying JRuby on Rails]\n* [http://recompile.net/2007/09/a_brief_introduction_to_jruby.html A Brief Introduction to JRuby on Rails with Grizzly]\n* [http://bitnami.org/stack/jrubystack All-in-one installer for quickly running a dev environment of Rails on JRuby].
