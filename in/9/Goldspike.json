It is useful to be able to package Ruby on Rails applications in a similar form, to enable seamless deployment to Java servers. This is what GoldSpike does.\n\n__TOC__\n\n== Creating a WAR of a Rails application ==\n\n=== Warbler ===\nSee <a href=\"{{project warbler page Home}}\">Warbler</a> for our currently recommended way to package your Rails applications as a <tt>.war</tt> file for deployment to a Java app server.\n\nSee also [[Jruby on Rails on Tomcat]] (Warbler related info).\n\n''Note this section will be expanded in the near future.''\n\n=== GoldSpike Rake Plugin ===\nFirst, install the plugin:\n  script/plugin install http://jruby-extras.rubyforge.org/svn/trunk/rails-integration/plugins/goldspike\n\n'''Note:''' The script above doesn't work on JRuby under Windows XP. You'll need to install the [[Running Rails with ActiveRecord-JDBC|ActiveRecord-JDBC]] gem before you can use the rake-tasks below. You install it with the command:\n gem install activerecord-jdbc-adapter --no-rdoc --no-ri\n\nMake sure that the plugin is installed, and run the following command:\n rake war:standalone:create\n\nIf you want to run a lot of JRuby web applications on an application server, it might be more efficient to install JRuby on your server's classpath and create a war containing just the application code:\n rake war:shared:create\n\nTry out your application as a web archive using Jetty:\n rake war:standalone:run\n\n== Building GoldSpike from source ==\n\nCheck out the source once:\n* svn checkout svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/jruby-extras/trunk/rails-integration\n* cd rails-integration\n* set GEM_HOME to point to your gem repository, so that the tests can be run (typically something like <jruby home>/lib/ruby/gems/1.8) (use \"/\" instead of \"\\\" on Windows)\n* mvn install\n\n=== Development Environment ===\n\n==== Eclipse ====\nThe following command will download all the required jar files and create the Eclipse project for you:\n mvn eclipse:eclipse\n\nAfter this you need to set the M2_REPO variable within Eclipse to point to your local Maven repository. This is typically at <tt>~/.m2/repository</tt>.\n\n==== NetBeans ====\n??? \n\n\n==== IntelliJ IDEA ====\nThe following command will download all the required jar files and create the project for you:\n mvn idea:idea \n\nAlternatively, you can open the pom directly on newer versions of IDEA, which will automatically convert it into a project.\n\n=== How to Debug Problems ===\n\n== Frequently Asked Questions ==\n\n=== Connecting to a database ===\nTo enable ActiveRecord you'll need to specify a database connection and package appropriate JDBC drivers.\n\nAdding the JDBC driver is done by adding library dependencies into <tt>config/war.rb</tt>. Create it if it doesn't exist.\n\nFor example, the MySQL driver can be included in the WAR with the following line:\n maven_library 'mysql', 'mysql-connector-java', '5.0.4'\n\nNext, configure <tt>database.yml</tt> to enable the use of <tt>ActiveRecord-JDBC</tt> as the ActiveRecord database driver. \n\n'''Note:''' At present WAR files are set to <b>production by default</b>.\n\nUsing our MySQL example again, this becomes:\n<pre>\nproduction:\n  adapter: jdbc\n  driver: com.mysql.jdbc.Driver\n  url: jdbc:mysql://localhost/sample_production\n  username: root\n  password:\n  host: localhost\n</pre>\n\nUpdate <tt>config/environment.rb</tt>.  See step '9' of [[Running Rails with ActiveRecord-JDBC]].\n\nNow when you use the web application, it should use JDBC drivers from Java to connect to the database.\n\n=== Using a connection from a pool via JNDI ===\n\nRails-Integration comes with rake tasks to create a war file for the rails app and configure a [http://jetty.mortbay.org jetty]\nweb server. To configure JNDI support, the following changes are required to be done...\n\n'''1. Add the data source configuration to the <tt>jetty.xml</tt> file.'''\n\n'''Note:''' Every time you run the rake task - war:standalone:run, the <tt>jetty.xml</tt> is recreated. Therefore, I suggest that you modify the rails-integration war plugin library, called <tt>run.rb</tt> and add the entries below in the appropriate place.\n\nFor instance, for Oracle data source:\n\n    &lt;new id=\"MyApp1\" class=\"org.mortbay.jetty.plus.naming.Resource\"&gt;\n    &lt;arg&gt;jdbc/MyApp&lt;/arg&gt;\n    &lt;arg&gt;\n    &lt;new class=\"oracle.jdbc.pool.OracleConnectionPoolDataSource\"&gt;\n    &lt;set name=\"URL\"&gt;jdbc:oracle:thin:@192.168.2.23:1521:swami&lt;/set&gt;\n    &lt;set name=\"User\"&gt;myapp&lt;/set&gt;\n    &lt;set name=\"Password\"&gt;myapp&lt;/set&gt;\n    &lt;/new&gt;\n    &lt;/arg&gt;\n    &lt;/new&gt;\n \nFor the full list of configuration details for various databases, see [http://docs.codehaus.org/display/JETTY/DataSource+Examples Jetty DataSource+Examples].\n\n'''Note:''' As stated in the Jetty documentation, the above entries can be updated in <tt>jetty-env.xml</tt> or <tt>jetty-web.xml</tt> as well. The scope of this configuration depends on where you put this configuration information.\n\n'''2. Now, search for the following section in your <tt>jetty.xml</tt> (or the <tt>run.rb</tt> file):'''\n    &lt;New class=\"org.mortbay.jetty.webapp.WebAppContext\"&gt;\n\nAdd the following entries after the two &lt;Arg&gt; entries:\n    &lt;Set name=\"ConfigurationClasses\"&gt;\n    &lt;Array id=\"plusConfig\" type=\"java.lang.String\"&gt;\n    &lt;Item&gt;org.mortbay.jetty.webapp.WebInfConfiguration&lt;/Item&gt;\n    &lt;Item&gt;org.mortbay.jetty.plus.webapp.EnvConfiguration&lt;/Item&gt;\n    &lt;Item&gt;org.mortbay.jetty.plus.webapp.Configuration&lt;/Item&gt;\n    &lt;Item&gt;org.mortbay.jetty.webapp.JettyWebXmlConfiguration&lt;/Item&gt;\n    &lt;Item&gt;org.mortbay.jetty.webapp.TagLibConfiguration&lt;/Item&gt;\n    &lt;/Array&gt;\n    &lt;/Set&gt;\n\n'''3. Specify the JNDI Logical Name for the web application.'''\n\nAdd the following entries in your <tt>web.xml</tt> under WEB-INF folder of your war file. \n\n'''Note:''' Every time you run the rake task - war:standalone:run, web.xml is recreated.  Therefore, I suggest that you modify the rails-integration war plugin library <tt>create_war.rb</tt> and add the entries below in the appropriate place.\n    &lt;resource-ref&gt;\n    &lt;description&gt;My DataSource Reference&lt;/description&gt;\n    &lt;res-ref-name&gt;jdbc/MyApp&lt;/res-ref-name&gt;\n    &lt;res-type&gt;javax.sql.DataSource&lt;/res-type&gt;\n    &lt;res-auth&gt;Container&lt;/res-auth&gt;\n    &lt;/resource-ref&gt;\n\n'''Note:''' In the trunk version, the above entries are already added.  All you have to do is setup the JNDI name in the property <tt>datasource_jndi_name</tt> inside <tt>war_config.rb</tt>.\n\n'''4. To add JNDI support, Jetty requires two more libraries: Jetty-Naming and Jetty-Plus.'''\n\nThe best way to do this is to modify the rails-integration war plugin library <tt>war_config.rb</tt>. Search for <tt>add_jetty_library</tt> and append the following lines telling the war_config to download the two libraries as well:\n    add_jetty_library(maven_library('org.mortbay.jetty', 'jetty-plus', '6.1.1'))\n    add_jetty_library(maven_library('org.mortbay.jetty', 'jetty-naming', '6.1.1'))\n\n'''5. Modify your <tt>database.yml</tt> to use JNDI.'''\n    production:\n      adapter: jdbc\n      jndi: java:comp/env/jdbc/MyApp\n      driver: oracle\n\nThats it! Your rails web application is ready to run with JNDI Data source.\n\n=== How do I use a specific JRuby release? ===\nAdd the following line to <tt>config/war.rb</tt>\n maven_library 'org.jruby', 'jruby-complete', '0.9.9-SNAPSHOT'\n\n=== Which version of Rails is used? ===\nIf RAILS_GEM_VERSION is set in <tt>environment.rb</tt>, this will be used. Otherwise, the latest installed release of Ruby on Rails is used.\n\nHowever, you might want to manually specify a version of Rails to use. This can be done by adding a gem dependency to <tt>config/war.rb</tt>, such as:\n add_gem 'rails', '= 1.2.3'\n\n=== Can I use servlet filters? ===\nYes you can. There is an example on how to do this on the [[CAS filter]] page.\n\n=== How do you add JAR files to the resulting webapp? ===\nPut them under <tt>lib/java</tt> (create that directory if needed), and they'll propagate to the resulting web application.  \n\n'''Note:''' I had to add a maven_library directive to my <tt>config/war.rb</tt> to make this work. In GoldSpike 1.3, <tt>include_library(name,version)</tt> in <tt>config/war.rb</tt> is supposed to provide the ability to add Java libraries from either <tt>lib/java</tt> or <tt>JRUBY_HOME/lib</tt>, but the functionality has been broken for a while. A patch is available here:<br/>\nhttp://rubyforge.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=13963&group_id=2014&atid=7859\n\n=== Which Java EE servers can I use ? ===\nGoldSpike has been tested on:\n* [http://glassfish.dev.java.net GlassFish]\n* [http://jetty.mortbay.org/ Jetty]\n* [http://tomcat.apache.org/ Tomcat]\n* [http://www.bea.com/weblogic/ WebLogic]\n* [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/techjournal/0801_shillington/0801_shillington.html WebSphere]\n\n=== How do I add dependent gems to the war? ===\nUse 'add_gem' in war.rb.  For example:\n add_gem 'rmagick4j', '= 0.3.3'\n\n=== How do I configure the number of requests GoldSpike can handle? ===\nThe number of simultaneous requests GoldSpike can process is based on the number of JRuby runtimes it creates.\n\nOnce GoldSpike has been run, it will create <tt>WEB-INF/web.xml</tt> under your Rails application.\nThe following <tt>context-params</tt> in <tt>web.xml</tt> can be used to configure GoldSpike:\n\nMaximum number of runtimes:\n jruby.pool.maxActive (defaults to 4)\nMinimum number of runtimes:  \n jruby.pool.minIdle (defaults to 2)\nInitial number of runtimes:\n jruby.pool.initialSize (defaults to jruby.pool.minIdle)\nHow often in milliseconds to check if more runtimes are needed:\n jruby.pool.checkInterval (defaults to 1000)\n\n=== What should I do? I get \"Could not load Rails. See the logs for more details.\" error message. ===\nThis means that an exception was thrown while GoldSpike attempted to initialize the Rails application. This can be caused by a number of problems, for example:\n* Failure to connect to the database\n* Missing gems from the war\n* Missing required jars which are loaded from <tt>environment.rb</tt>\n\nThe best way to go about debugging this is to check the container log file. It should show the message and trace for the exception that was encountered.\n\n=== How do I avoid bundling files such as .svn, .DS_Store, etc. into the WAR file? ===\nI would LOVE to find the \"proper\" answer to this. I tried adding the following to <tt>war.rb</tt>, but it only caused an exclusion at the top level, possibly because the file list that finally gets passed to the <tt>jar</tt> command is only a list of the top-level files and directories:\n exclude_files File.join(\".\",\"**\",\".svn\")\n\nI ended up having to hack the GoldSpike code to run the following zip command immediately after the WAR file was built (in <tt>packer.rb</tt>), which removes the designated files from the jar manually, throughout the ENTIRE jar file:\n zip -q -d #{os_target_file} \\*.svn/\\* \\*.DS_Store\n\n*os_target_file is the .jar filename\n* .DS_Store is the OS X directory metadata file. \n* Backslashes are significant and necessary: See the zip man page!\n\nI can't think of a circumstance when you wouldn't want to exclude these files from a WAR, so I didn't make it an option. Works great.\n\n=== web.xml Notes ===\n\n''After running warbler and looking at the resulting web.xml I was able to infer the following - please add or correct. Thx''\n\nWithin your web.xml you can set the following to tailor the WAR structure to your liking. Set inside &lt;web-app&gt; like:\n\n<pre>\n <context-param>\n \t<param-name>jruby.standalone</param-name>\n \t<param-value>true</param-value>\n </context-param>\n</pre>\n\n jruby.standalone - true/false (what does this do?)\n jruby.session_store - \"db\"\n jruby.home\n jruby.pool.maxActive - 4\n jruby.pool.minIdle - 2\n jruby.pool.checkInterval - 1000 (ms)\n jruby.pool.maxWait - 30000 (ms)\n \n rails.root - path to rails app within the war file / webapp dir\n rails.env  - development|test|production\n \n files.root - absolute path to public files within the war file / webapp dir\n files.default - servlet id to use if a file cannot be found\n files.prefix - prefix added to static files\n files.welcome -\n\nAs with Rails, if a static file exists it will be served, otherwise it will try to dispatch via Rails.\n\nStatic file requests are (can be) serviced via <tt>org.jruby.webapp.FileServlet</tt>.\n\nRails requests are serviced via <tt>org.jruby.webapp.RailsServlet</tt>.\n\nYou should map / through the FileServlet\n<pre>\n <servlet-mapping>\n \t<servlet-name>files</servlet-name>\n \t<url-pattern>/</url-pattern>\n </servlet-mapping>\n</pre>\n\nAdditionally, System Properties you can set:\n\n jruby.objectspace.enabled\n gem.path\n gem.home\n\n== More Information ==\n* [http://blogs.sun.com/arungupta/entry/rails_and_java_ee_integration Rails and Java EE integration - Servlet co-bundled and invoked from Rails app] (Arun Gupta)\n* [http://rubyforge.org/mail/?group_id=2014 RubyForge jruby-extras-devel Archives]\n\n== Release roadmap ==\n\n=== 1.5 - January 08 ===\n* JRuby 1.1 support\n* Rails 2.0 support\n* Deprecate plugin, recommend the use of Warbler\n* Bug 16108 - HttpOutput flush doesn't send headers - Patch by Matt Burke\n\n=== 1.4 - December 07 ===\n* Allow FileServlet to work even if activation.jar is not present at runtime\n* Make rails.root param assume it's relative to the webapp\n* Make pom download and install rails if necessary\n* Added periodical task scheduler\n\n=== 1.3 - August 07 ===\n* Update to JRuby 1.0.1\n* Support for WebLogic (tested with 9.2)\n* Fix PUT, DELETE, etc requests not being passed on to RailsServlet.\n* Add support for HEAD requests to FileServlet.\n* Fix for a deadlock situation\n* Add support for adding arbitrary files to WEB-INF, also looking at timestamps and so on to not add unnecessarily.\n* Spring plugin\n* Support for caching, by Li Xiao.\n* Drop support for preparsing the syntax tree\n* Don't add AR-JDBC or Rails gems if they're already added to vendor.
