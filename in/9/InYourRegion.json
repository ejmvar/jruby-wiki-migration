This is a good thing, too, since there are Ruby, Java, and JRuby conferences, events, and user groups all over the world.\n\nThe users listed on this wiki page have volunteered to act as local \"JRuby Delegates\" when the JRuby core team members are unable to travel. They can answer questions about JRuby, meet up for lunch/dinner/hacking, speak at nearby conferences, and generally act as a local JRuby \"expert\" for some definition of \"expert\". You should feel comfortable contacting them directly with questions, and know that they'll either help you or put you in contact with someone who can.\n\nIf you are interested in joining this list, we would recommend you meet the following criteria:\n\n* Day to day JRuby user\n* Have implemented something nontrivial using JRuby or contributed nontrivial patches\n* Comfortable with open-source ethos\n* Comfortable speaking to people, either one on one or as a group (presentation)\n\nIn return, the JRuby community will help you fulfill the role of JRuby Delegate, providing speaking tips, presentation material, demos, and more.
