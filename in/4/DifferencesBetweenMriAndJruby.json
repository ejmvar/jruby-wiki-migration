Some differences are due to bugs, and those are not reported here. This page is for differences that are not bugs.\n\n__TOC__\n\n== Native C Extensions\n\nJRuby cannot run native C extensions.  Popular libraries have all generally been ported to Java Native Extensions.  Also now [http://kenai.com/projects/ruby-ffi/pages/Home|FFI] has become a popular alternative to binding to C libraries.  FFI obviates the need to write a large chunk native extensions.\n\n== Continuations ==\n\nJRuby does not support continuations (Kernel.callcc).\n\n\n== Invoking external processes ==\n\nOn windows, jruby is a little smarter when launching external processes. If the executable file is not a binary executable (.exe), mri requires you give the file suffix as well, but jruby manages without it.\n\nAn example: say you have file foo.bat on your PATH and want to run it. \n\nsystem( 'foo' ) # works on jruby, fails on mri\n\nsystem( 'foo.bat' ) # works both in jruby and mri\n\n== Fork is not implemented ==\n\nJRuby doesn't implement fork() on any platform, including those where fork() is available in MRI.\n\n== Native Endian is Big Endian ==\n\nSince the JVM presents a 'compatible' CPU to JRuby, the 'native' endianness of JRuby is Big Endian. This does matter for\noperations which depend on that like String.pack() and Array.unpack() for formats like \"I\", \"i\", \"S\" and \"s\".\n\n== Time precision ==\n\nSince it is not possible to obtain usec precision under a JVM, Time.now.usec cannot return values with microsecond precision.\n\nExample:\n\n > Time.now.usec\n => 582000\n\nKeep this in mind when counting on usec precision in your code.\n","created_at":"2009-06-12T19:07:51Z","content_type":"application/vnd.com.kenai.page.revision+json"}
